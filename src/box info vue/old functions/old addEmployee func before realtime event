 here we use- "this.$emit('itemAdded');" as event listener
 and act with classic event that component send event to his dad(his view page:"backOffice")
 and then "backOffice" activate func that change value of variable from false to true and opposite
 then catch the variable into props in other component
 and put "watch" on this props

old addEmployee:

 addEmployee() {
      firebaseDatabase.create({entity: this.tableName, employees: this.employee})
          .then(() => {
             this.$emit('itemAdded');
          })
    },
